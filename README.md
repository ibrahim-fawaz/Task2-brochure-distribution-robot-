# Task2-brochure-distribution-robot-
this is a rough sketch of the brochure distribution robot 

the right hand is to wave ONLY, the left hand appears as if it is holding the paper printer,
the screen in the chest could be very helpful for deaf people or showing the clients LOGO.

The cool thing in my opinion is that its simple no need for a lot of motors or joints and parts, the challenging thing about this design is the printer size and efficiency and speed of printing
